    "content": "10051005\tA common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families:
      origin, phenotypic expression, and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer .\tThe
      frequency , origin , and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously
      identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC) was
      investigated . The mutation ( A-- > T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5
      leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2
      mutation so far reported . Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33
      colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has
      reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed . In contrast ,
      the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal
      families from Newfoundland . To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer
      families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) ,
      haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed . Within the
      English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2
      splice site mutation in most families . In contrast , a common haplotype was identified
      at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families .
      These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by
      others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families . We calculated age related risks
      of all , colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A-- > T MSH2 mutation
      carriers ( n = 76 ) for all patients and for men and women separately . For both sexes combined ,
      the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers  and for colorectal cancer were 0 . 86 and 0 . 57 ,
      respectively . The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher ( p < 0.01 ) in males
      than females ( 0 . 63 v 0 . 30 and 0 . 84 v 0 . 44 at ages 50 and 60 years , respectively ) .
      For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer ( 0 . 5 at age 60 years ) and premenopausal
      ovarian cancer ( 0 . 2 at 50 years ) . These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks
      have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer
      susceptibility modifiers .\n "
