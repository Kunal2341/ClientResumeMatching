No deficiency in the opsonic activity of the serum was found , and the results of basic coagulation studies of the plasma were normal . On investigation of the patients family , two sisters were found to have the same deficiency but were otherwise in good health . The seven other siblings were heterozygous for C7 deficiency , while the paternal aunt had a normal C7 level . In the third generation , six children of the three homozygous sisters and five children of heterozygotes were available for testing . Studies of the HLA antigens in all the 22 subjects and in three spouses indicated no close linkage between the CM deficienty and the HLA system . In addition , the simultaneous occurrence of two hereditary complement deficiencies ( C2 and C7 ) was discovered in one family of this remarkable kindred . . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1033","endOffset":"1046"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"196","endOffset":"244"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"7","endOffset":"31"}}},{"displayName":"CompositeMention","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1128","endOffset":"1166"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"723","endOffset":"736"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"169","endOffset":"191"}}}]}

We describe five families for which direct sequencing of the coding region of the VHL gene had failed to identify the family-specific mutation . Further molecular analysis revealed deletions involving the VHL gene in each of these families . In four families , partial deletions of one or more exons were detected by Southern blot analysis . In the fifth family , FISH analysis demonstrated the deletion of the entire VHL gene . Our results show that ( quantitative ) Southern blot analysis is a sensitive method for detecting germline deletions of the VHL gene and should be implemented in routine DNA diagnosis for VHL disease . Our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for pheochromocytoma . Further unraveling of genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease has revealed that families with a full or partial deletion of the VHL gene exhibit a phenotype with a preponderance of central nervous system hemangioblastoma . . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"144","endOffset":"169"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"943","endOffset":"946"}}},{"displayName":"CompositeMention","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"340","endOffset":"387"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1212","endOffset":"1223"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"294","endOffset":"310"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1007","endOffset":"1018"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1343","endOffset":"1382"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"595","endOffset":"598"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"94","endOffset":"97"}}},{"displayName":"CompositeMention","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"206","endOffset":"250"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1290","endOffset":"1293"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"472","endOffset":"475"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"75","endOffset":"92"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"313","endOffset":"333"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1136","endOffset":"1152"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"808","endOffset":"811"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"105","endOffset":"138"}}}]}

The molecular analysis demonstrated that in the Habbanite population , the mutation occurred on an allele with the PD mutation . The loss of ARSA activity is due to a point mutation C \u003e T leading to a change of proline to leucine . MLD is also frequent among Moslem Arabs in Jerusalem . The mutation is a transition G \u003e A destroying the splice donor site of exon 2 . This mutation has been reported in patients with the late infantile MLD from different ethnic groups .

The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations , such as Denys-Drash syndrome ( DDS ) , can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease . DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis , XY pseudohermaphroditism , and / or Wilms tumor ( WT ) . DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1 , which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger ( ZF ) region . We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele , Wt1 ( tmT396 ) , which truncates ZF3 at codon 396 , induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice . Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event , implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice . However , the mutant WT1 ( tmT396 ) protein accounted for only 5 % of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT .

The gene for Alstrom syndrome ( ALMS1 ) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - French Acadian and North African . Pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod ( logarithm of the odds ratio ) scores of 3 . 84 and 2 . 9 , respectively . To confirm these findings , a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for Alstrom syndrome . A maximum two-point lod score of 7 . 13 ( theta \u003d 0 . 00 ) for marker D2S2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9 . 16 for marker D2S2110 were observed , further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13 . No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families .

Its clinical features are variably expressed , but include cleft lip and / or cleft palate , lip pits and hypodontia . All VWS families studied to date map the disease gene to a \u003c 2 cM region of chromosome 1q32 , with no evidence of locus heterogeneity . The aim of this study is to refine the localization of the VWS gene and to further assess possible heterogeneity . We analyzed four multiplex VWS families . All available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the VWS candidate gene region . We performed two-point and multipoint limit of detection ( LOD ) score analyses using a high penetrance autosomal dominant model . All families showed positive LOD scores without any recombination in the candidate region . The largest two-point LOD score was 5 . 87 87 . Our assay method for short tandem repeat ( STR ) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes , and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the VWS gene in each of our four families . We observed a striking pattern of STR allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four Caucasian VWS families recruited at three different locations in the US . These results suggest the possibility of a unique origin for a mutation responsible for many or most cases of VWS . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"380","endOffset":"392"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1344","endOffset":"1347"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"616","endOffset":"619"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"177","endOffset":"199"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"408","endOffset":"418"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1667","endOffset":"1670"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"214","endOffset":"254"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"395","endOffset":"403"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1493","endOffset":"1496"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"699","endOffset":"702"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"202","endOffset":"205"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"425","endOffset":"428"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"36","endOffset":"58"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"833","endOffset":"836"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"361","endOffset":"370"}}}]}

To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene , we conducted a population-based study in Busselton , Australia . In 1994 , we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation ( which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels ) in 3011 unrelated white adults . We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values ( 45 percent or higher ) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation . We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher . The subjects were followed for up to four years . RESULTS  Sixteen of the subjects ( 0 . 5 percent ) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation , and 424 ( 14 . 1 percent ) were heterozygous . The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous ; in 1 subject it was 43 percent . Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis , and 12 had not . Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994 ; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998 , and 1 had a decrease , although the value remained elevated . The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range . Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy ; 3 had hepatic fibrosis , and 1 , who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption , had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis . Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis , such as hepatomegaly , skin pigmentation , and arthritis . CONCLUSIONS  In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry , 0 . 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene . However , only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis , and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period .\n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1393","endOffset":"1408"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"68","endOffset":"83"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1871","endOffset":"1895"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"2074","endOffset":"2083"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1816","endOffset":"1845"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"203","endOffset":"218"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"2035","endOffset":"2047"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1768","endOffset":"1784"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"114","endOffset":"140"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1998","endOffset":"2024"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"2308","endOffset":"2323"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1852","endOffset":"1861"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"294","endOffset":"314"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"2050","endOffset":"2067"}}}]}

The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration in the CTX plasmas was 14 . 5 + / - 3 . 2 mg / dl , about one-third the normal value .

We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19 / nm23 . In neuroblastoma , higher levels of p19 / nm23 , which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene , large tumor mass , and metastasis , were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease . Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors , we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation . The levels of p19 / nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells . The amount of p19 / nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis . In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia , p19 / nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes . Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin , which inhibits proliferation , blocked the increase in p19 / nm23 ; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide , which induces terminal differentiation , resulted in diminished levels of p19 / nm23 . Our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-H1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity . . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"597","endOffset":"603"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1383","endOffset":"1391"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"419","endOffset":"432"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1070","endOffset":"1078"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"243","endOffset":"249"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"911","endOffset":"919"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"701","endOffset":"707"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"535","endOffset":"540"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1135","endOffset":"1149"}}}]}
{"textSnippet":{"content":"10732811\tCharacterization of the rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene.\tMachado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia . The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable and expanded ( CAG ) n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function . In Caucasians , repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 ( SCA3 ) . In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1 / SCA3 gene we cloned the rat homologue and studied its expression . The rat and human ataxin-3 genes are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88 % . However , the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the published human sequence . The ( CAG ) n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents . The expression pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analyses . The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length . In rat testis , a smaller transcript of 1 . 3 kb was identified . Transcription of rsca3 was detected in most rat tissues including brain . Analyzing the expression level of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD . Thus additional molecules and / or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain areas . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"98","endOffset":"101"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"212","endOffset":"241"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1587","endOffset":"1590"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"167","endOffset":"194"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"563","endOffset":"567"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"531","endOffset":"560"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1685","endOffset":"1720"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"73","endOffset":"95"}}}]}

A total of eight putative disease-causing alterations were identified  four of these are frameshifts and two are nonsense mutations . In addition , we found two missense mutations , one of which changes the final cysteine of the BRCA1 zinc finger motif to glycine . These data are consistent with a tumour suppressor model , and support the notion that this candidate gene is in fact BRCA1 . The heterogeneity of mutations , coupled with the large size of the gene , indicates that clinical application of BRCA1 mutation testing will be technically challenging . . \n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"CompositeMention","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"65","endOffset":"90"}}},{"displayName":"CompositeMention","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"141","endOffset":"171"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"640","endOffset":"646"}}}]}

We adopted both single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and a method of analysis involving the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) followed by a protein truncation test ( PTT ) . DNA sequencing confirmed all alterations represented by aberrant bands . Germline mutations were identified in 38 patients ( 61 % ) . Nineteen of the detected mutations were presumed to be novel , thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in Korean FAP patients . In the initial 48 patients , SSCP analysis was followed by PTT for those patients for whom no detectable mutations were found by SSCP . Using this combined approach , we identified germline APC gene mutations in 29 of the 48 FAP patients ( 60 % ) , including 6 patients in whom SSCP analysis failed to distinguish the mutant allele . In the 14 later patients , we identified truncating mutations in 9 patients ( 64 % ) using PTT only . Our results confirm that the mutation detection rate with PTT was superior to that with SSCP , and suggest that PTT would be a more practical screening method to detect germline mutations of the APC gene in FAP patients .\n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1455","endOffset":"1458"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"297","endOffset":"300"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"54","endOffset":"84"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"231","endOffset":"234"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1014","endOffset":"1017"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"35","endOffset":"38"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1467","endOffset":"1470"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"809","endOffset":"812"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"198","endOffset":"228"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"268","endOffset":"294"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1049","endOffset":"1052"}}}]}
{"textSnippet":{"content":"10446987\tThe dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type Ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional PDGF-BB.\tDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 ( COLIA1 ) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B-chain ( PDGFB ) gene . To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion protein , we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion . Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells . The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells . The presence of dimeric COLIA1 / PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies . Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1 / PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB . Finally , COLIA1 / PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s . c c . injection into nude mice , and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B . We conclude that the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop . Our findings , thus , suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B .\n "},"annotations":[{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"244","endOffset":"248"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1455","endOffset":"1460"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1796","endOffset":"1820"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"13","endOffset":"44"}}},{"displayName":"Modifier","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1589","endOffset":"1594"}}},{"displayName":"DiseaseClass","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1401","endOffset":"1407"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1569","endOffset":"1573"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"210","endOffset":"241"}}},{"displayName":"SpecificDisease","textExtraction":{"textSegment":{"startOffset":"1787","endOffset":"1791"}}}]}
