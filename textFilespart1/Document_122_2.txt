after hours as well. In bound experts work hard to ensure everything is on the shelves and that
they are fully stocked.
At Target I lifted freight others were not able to lift
I kept track of stock in the back room and organized it so other employees could access

On many occasions I would patrol the back room and look for anyone who needed help
I helped customers on the floor as well when I was stocking or unloading
Computer Refurbishment Technician/Computer Disassembly technician | Blue Star
Recyclers | August 2015 to February 2016
At Blue Star Recyclers I worked with computers and people to aid in keeping waste out of the
landfills. I disassembled computers of all types and ages. Eventually, I switched over to the
refurbishment department and worked the front desk as well. I even helped with pickups. During
these we would take an empty truck to businesses that called us, and we would pick up old or
broken electronics they wanted to recycle.
Here I disassembled and refurbished around 40 computers in an 8-hour shift
I handled the organization of the warehouse portion of the business
When I switched over to refurbishment, I was the one who would hand off the computers
to those in federally funded housing
We worked with a company called pc's for people and I bridged the gap between us and
them by helping them sell computers and by providing the computers
